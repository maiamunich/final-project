                        Hi, my name is Maia Nerea Munich. I am currently a student at Fordham University studying Computer Science with a 
                        Minor in Visual Arts and Cybersecurity. I started doing art at a very young age, but became fully engrossed by it 
                        in 9th grade and haven't stopped since. I am a very passionate person and I love to create. I love to paint and create art. 
                        I am also very interested in cybersecurity and I am currently working on a project to help people not get scam emails.

            <h2>My Medium</h2>
            <p>
                I love working with acrylic paint, that is my main medium. But have also worked with many different forms such as 
                ceramics, oil, charcoal, and many more. I love to work with many different mediums and I am always trying to learn new things. 
                I am very intrigued by making things with my own hands and I love to see the final product.
            </p>

            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
            <p>
                In my artwork I tend to explore politics and the affect it has on my life. Although most of my recent work 
                has been more focused on more personal lived experiences, I tend to gravitate towards more political and hard subjects. 
                I hope that through my art I am able to make the people who see it think and feel, but also to make them realize they are not alone.
